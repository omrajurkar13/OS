# Deadlock-Detection  

---  

This repository contains a Python-based Deadlock Detection System that helps detect and prevent deadlocks in multi-threaded applications. Deadlocks occur when multiple processes or threads wait for each other indefinitely, preventing further execution. This project provides a solution to identify and resolve such issues efficiently.  

## What is Deadlock Detection?  
Deadlock detection is a technique used in operating systems and concurrent programming to identify situations where processes are stuck waiting for resources that will never be released. It is crucial in multi-threaded applications, databases, and distributed systems to prevent system freezes and performance degradation.  

### Common Causes of Deadlocks:  
- **Mutual Exclusion**: When a resource can only be held by one process at a time.  
- **Hold and Wait**: When a process holding at least one resource is waiting for additional resources.  
- **No Preemption**: Resources cannot be forcibly taken from a process.  
- **Circular Wait**: A set of processes are waiting on each other in a circular chain.  

## Features  
✅ **Automatic Deadlock Detection** – Identifies deadlocks before they impact system performance.  
✅ **Graphical Interface** – A user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter for easy interaction.  
✅ **Efficient Algorithm** – Implements optimized logic to check for deadlocks quickly.  
✅ **Simulation and Prevention** – Detects deadlocks and helps prevent them through process scheduling.  

## Project Structure  
- **main.py** – Implements deadlock detection logic and handles the core computations and create gui using tkinter python framework.
